Server Management for Microservices Architecture
Directory Creation & Organization:

    Create a directory named "microservices_architecture".
    Inside "microservices_architecture", create 12 subdirectories, each named after a microservice (e.g., "user_service", "order_service", "inventory_service", etc.).
    Inside each microservice directory, create files representing configurations or components (e.g., "docker_config.txt", "api_endpoints.txt") related to that microservice.

Move and Rename Files:

    Move a file (e.g., "docker_config.txt") from one microservice directory to another.
    Rename a file within a directory (e.g., rename "api_endpoints.txt" to "api_doc.txt") and verify the change by listing the contents of the directory.

Navigation & Listing Files:

    Navigate to the "microservices_architecture" directory.
    List the contents of the directory and verify the presence of all subdirectories (representing individual microservices) and files created in the previous task.

File Permissions Management:

    Create a file named "config.txt" in the "microservices_architecture" directory.
    Change the permissions of the file so that only the user has read, write, and execute permissions.
    Verify the permission changes by listing the file's details.

Backup Files:

    Create a backup of a file (e.g., "config.txt") by copying it to another directory (e.g., "backup").
    Verify the copy operation by listing the contents of the backup directory.

Removing Files & Directories:

    Delete one of the files in the "microservices_architecture" directory (e.g., delete "docker_config.txt").
    Remove an empty subdirectory from one of the microservice directories (e.g., remove the "inventory_service" directory if it's empty).

Creating a Script for File Generation:

    Write a script that creates 100 files inside the "microservices_architecture" directory, with each file representing a different microservice component (e.g., "component_1.txt", "component_2.txt", etc.).

Exploring File History:

    View the command history to see the last 20 commands executed.
    Search the history for any command related to file manipulation or microservices architecture activities.

System Monitoring:

    Check the system's uptime to ensure the Microservices Architecture Server is running continuously.
    View the system's load and resource usage statistics to monitor the performance of microservices deployment and management.

Checking File Ownership and Permissions:

    Check the ownership and group of the "config.txt" file and verify whether they are correct for the microservices architecture context.

Ping Test & Network Verification:

    Verify network connectivity by pinging a remote server (e.g., a container registry or a cloud instance running one of your microservices).
    Record the response times and verify the connectivity between the microservices.

Search for Specific Files or Content:

    Search for a specific file within the "microservices_architecture" directory by its name (e.g., search for "docker_config.txt").
    Search for a specific string of text (e.g., "api_endpoint") inside one of the files in the directory.

Create a Directory for Each User:

    Create a directory for each microservices developer in the system and assign appropriate permissions to manage their respective services.

Creating a Script for Directory Cleanup:

    Write a script that deletes all empty subdirectories from the "microservices_architecture" directory to clean up after old or removed services.

File Sorting & Management:

    Sort files in a directory by size and then list the files based on their size, helping to organize configuration files or logs by their size.
    Create a report listing the largest and smallest files in a directory to better manage resource-heavy files.

File Type Identification:

    Identify and list files of a specific type (e.g., .yaml, .json, .txt) used for microservices configuration, logs, or documentation in the "microservices_architecture" directory.

File Compression and Archive:

    Compress a directory (e.g., "user_service") into a single archive file to create a backup of microservice configurations and resources.
    Verify the contents of the archive without extracting it to ensure it contains all the necessary files.
